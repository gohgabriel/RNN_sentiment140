# RNN (Sentiment140)

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that describes my process in developing a RNN model, based on the [Sentiment140 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140). 

The first half of the code is adapted from [tthustla](https://github.com/tthustla/twitter_sentiment_analysis_part1/), focusing on traditional methods (i.e. logistic regression) for comparing the NN model's metrics. The subsequent code to train a RNN model is my own.

The end of the notebook denotes code that can be used to deploy the RNN model and make predictions from new text. My model is available upon request, although following the steps in the notebook should allow for creating your own model.

# RNN (SEMeval 2017)

There is also additional code that creates another RNN based on the SEMeval dataset. We also compare the performance of the two RNN models.
