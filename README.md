# RNN (Sentiment140)

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that describes my process in developing a RNN model, based on the [Sentiment140 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140). 

The end of the notebook denotes code that can be used to deploy the model and make predictions from new text. My model is available upon request, although following the steps in the notebook should allow for creating your own model.
